pgnlint
=======

pgnlint parses files in the Portable Game Notation format. So far it doesn't
do much more than that. Work in progress.

One of the reasons this project is taking a while to complete is that [a proper PGN linter pretty much has to be able to see if a move is legal](https://zuttobenkyou.wordpress.com/2012/01/27/problems-with-the-portable-game-notation-pgn-standard/).

[PGN sucks](http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/enhancedpgn.htm).
